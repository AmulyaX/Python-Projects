# Caesar Cipher

This Python project implements a Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text messages.

## How it Works

1. **Direction:** You'll be prompted to choose either `"encode"` or `"decode"` to specify whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
2. **Message:** Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. The program will convert the message to lowercase for consistency.
3. **Shift Number:** Provide a number that represents the amount of letters to shift in the Caesar Cipher. For example, a shift of 3 would move each letter three positions down the alphabet (wrapping around from 'z' to 'a' if necessary).
4. **Encryption/Decryption:** The program applies the Caesar Cipher algorithm based on your chosen direction and shift number.
5. **Restart:** You'll be given the option to restart the program or exit.
