# Guess the Letter

This program tests your letter-guessing skills against a secret list of words!

**Gameplay:**

1. The program will prompt you to enter a single character (letter).
2. It will then compare your guess against each word in its internal word list, checking each character individually.
3. If your guess matches any character within any word, the program will tell you how many words contain that letter.
4. You can keep guessing different letters to gain clues and ultimately identify the letter(s) present in the word list.
