# Password Generator

This program generates two random passwords based on your chosen complexity:

* **Customization:** Define the number of lowercase and uppercase letters, symbols, and numerics you want in your passwords.
* **Password Types:**
    * **Random Password in Order:** This password uses the characters you specify, maintaining the order you define (e.g., letters, symbols, numbers).
    * **Random Password Jumbled:** This password shuffles all the characters you provide, creating a more secure combination.

**Note:** Strong passwords are typically at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. This program helps you create passwords that adhere to these best practices.
